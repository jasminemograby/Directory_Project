## ✅ Improvements Made

1. **Feature-Add-Template:**
   - Added explicit "CRITICAL" instruction to automatically update `docs/project_customization.md`
   - Added format specification: Date, Feature, Rule, Impact, Status

2. If "Yes", AI asks follow-up questions
3. **AI automatically updates `docs/project_customization.md`** with new entry
4. Entry follows standardized format

### When Refining a Feature:
1. Pre-change scan reads `docs/project_customization.md`
2. Step 5 asks: "Does this refinement introduce new/changed customizations?"
3. If "Yes", AI asks follow-up questions
4. **AI automatically updates `docs/project_customization.md`** (new entry or update existing)
5. Update is logged in documentation checklist

## ✅ Conclusion

**Status:** All customizations are properly documented and the update process is now automated.

**Next Steps:** When using Feature-Add or Feature-Refine templates, AI will automatically:
