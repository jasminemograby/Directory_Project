# Template Update - Final Summary ✅

## Status: COMPLETE

All 17 templates have been fully updated with:
1. ✅ All hardcoded follow-up questions removed
2. ✅ Dynamic question generation instructions added
3. ✅ Explicit instruction for handling unexpected/new information
4. ✅ Complete information collection requirements
5. ✅ Verification before Generation Phase

## Key Addition: Handling Unexpected Information

**CRITICAL instruction added to ALL templates:**

> "If the user mentions something not yet asked but related to this template, dynamically generate follow-up questions until all related information is captured. Do not guess or assume - continue asking until all requirements are fully specified."

This ensures that:
- AI handles new/unexpected information from users
- No information is missed or assumed
- Questions adapt to user's actual answers
- Complete information is collected before proceeding
