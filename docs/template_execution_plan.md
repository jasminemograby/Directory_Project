# Template Execution Plan - Clarification

## Current Status

### Templates Mentioned in Requirements

The requirements mention that UI components should be designed during the **UI-UX-Design-Template.md** phase, but I notice:

1. **No template files exist** in the repository
2. **Templates were not provided** in the initial setup
3. **Work has been proceeding** with direct implementation based on:
   - `requirements.md`
   - `flow.md`
   - `architecture.md`
   - `roadmap.json`
   - `docs/ui_ux_requirements.md`

### What Has Been Done

✅ **Requirements Gathering** - `requirements.md` created  
✅ **Flow Documentation** - `flow.md` created  
✅ **Architecture** - `architecture.md` created  
✅ **Roadmap** - `roadmap.json` created  
✅ **UI/UX Requirements** - `docs/ui_ux_requirements.md` created  
✅ **Feature Implementation** - Following roadmap features directly

### Template Execution Plan

**Option 1: Execute Templates Now (Before Continuing)**
- Create template files based on the phases mentioned
- Execute each template phase systematically
- Document all decisions and implementations
- **Pros:** More structured, comprehensive documentation
- **Cons:** Slows down feature development

**Option 2: Continue Feature Development (Current Approach)**
- Continue building features based on roadmap
- Create template documentation retrospectively as needed
- Focus on core functionality first
- **Pros:** Faster feature delivery
- **Cons:** Less structured documentation upfront

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)**
- Continue building core features (user profiles, LinkedIn/GitHub integration)
- Create template documentation for completed features retrospectively
- Execute templates for new features going forward
- **Pros:** Balance between speed and documentation
- **Cons:** Some features lack template documentation

## Recommendation

Given the user's time constraints and need to focus on core features, I recommend:

1. **Continue with Option 3 (Hybrid)**
   - Build user profiles with LinkedIn/GitHub integration now
   - Create template documentation retrospectively for completed features
   - Execute templates for new features going forward

2. **If templates are critical**, I can:
   - Create template files now
   - Execute them for the next features
   - Document completed features retrospectively

---

## User Decision Needed

**Please confirm:**
1. Should I continue building features (user profiles) now?
2. Or should I create and execute templates first?
3. Or hybrid approach (build features, document with templates retrospectively)?

## Next Steps (Pending User Confirmation)

Once confirmed, I will:
1. ✅ Remove notification/email UI elements
2. ✅ Build user profile creation and display
3. ✅ Implement LinkedIn/GitHub integration with authorization
4. ✅ Integrate Gemini AI for profile analysis
5. ✅ Send data to Skills Engine microservice
6. ✅ Create template documentation as we go
