## Update Pattern Applied

All hardcoded follow-up questions are being replaced with "Instructions for AI" sections that tell the AI to:
1. Generate questions dynamically based on user answers
2. Ask only relevant questions based on what was mentioned
3. Progressively disclose information (ask follow-ups only when needed)
4. Adapt to specific services, platforms, or data types mentioned

## Next Steps

Continue updating remaining templates systematically, replacing all instances of:
- `**Dynamic Follow-ups (if Yes):**`
- `**If Yes:**` / `**If No:**`
- `**For each [item]:**`
- `**Question Xa-[Item]:**`

With dynamic generation instructions.
